# Pong

This is the basic pong game that you all probably are familiar.

This game is written in python 3.7 with the Turtle Graphics.

Note that this isn't the perfect version, it has some small minor bugs

In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

This game is played by 2 people, 1 controls the left paddle, the other one controls the right paddle

You can move the paddles up and down with:
  "W" and "S" keys for the left paddle, 
  "Up Arrow" and "Down Arrow" keys for the left paddle
  
 Your aim is to score 5 points, and if you do you simply win the game
 
 If you want to download the game and try it on your own, then you should download these python files

1) Download the files
2) Open temrinal, go to the directory that you downloaded the files and type `python main.py`or `python3 main.py`, depending on your python version
3) Play the game

Thanks for reading / being interested in this small project.
